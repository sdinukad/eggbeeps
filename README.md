# Egg Hatch Tick Alarm for Pokemmo
Simple app to help keep track of egg ticks when hatching eggs in PokeMMO.

## Details
* It will emit a slight beep at 1 tick and a louder double beep when eggs are hatched.
* Settings page will allow you to select if you have donator status or flame body which will reduce the tick count to hatch.
* Continous mode will keep going after one set is hatched so you don't need to click start after each set.

>If the next tick countdown gets bugged, you will need to reload the page. However it is only visual and you will still hear the egg beeps. (Possibly fixed already more testing needed)
